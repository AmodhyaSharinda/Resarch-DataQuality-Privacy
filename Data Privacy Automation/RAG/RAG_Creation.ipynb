Entities should identify the approach best suited to their security implementation and use that approach to validate the controls.

The defined approach supports entities with controls in place that meet PCI DSS requirements as stated. This approach may also suit entities that want more direction about how to meet security objectives, as well as entities new to information security or PCI DSS. Compensating Controls As part of the defined approach, entities that cannot meet a PCI DSS requirement explicitly as stated due to a legitimate and documented technical or business constraint may implement other, or compensating, controls, that sufficiently mitigate the risk associated with the requirement.',\n",

However, several requirements do not have a stated Customized Approach Objective; the customized approach is not an option for these requirements.

Often, seemingly insignificant paths to and from untrusted networks can provide unprotected pathways into sensitive systems. NSCs provide a key protection mechanism for any computer network.

For example, if only the last four digits are needed to perform a business function, PAN should be masked to only show the last four digits.

Customized Approach Objective Secret and private keys are stored in a secure form that prevents unauthorized retrieval or access. Applicability Notes It is not required that public keys be stored in one of these forms. Cryptographic keys stored as part of a key management system (KMS) that employs SCDs are acceptable. A cryptographic key that is split into two parts does not meet this requirement. Secret or private keys stored as key components or key shares must be generated via one of the following: • Using an approved random number generator and within an SCD, OR • According to ISO 19592 or equivalent industry standard for generation of secret key shares.',\n",

Cryptoperiods are often defined in terms of the period for which the key is active and/or the amount of cipher-text that has been produced by the key. Considerations for defining the cryptoperiod include, but are not limited to, the strength of the underlying algorithm, size or length of the key, risk of key compromise, and the sensitivity of the data being encrypted.',\n",
